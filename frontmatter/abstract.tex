\chapter*{Abstract}

{\bf A compulsory section, of at most $1$ page} 
\vspace{1cm} 

\noindent
This section should pr\'{e}cis the project context, aims and objectives,
and main contributions and achievements; the same section may be called
an abstract elsewhere.  The goal is to ensure the reader is clear about 
what the topic is, what you have done within this topic, {\em and} what 
your view of the outcome is.

The former aspects should be guided by your specification: essentially 
this section is a (very) short version of what is typically the first 
chapter.  The latter aspects should be presented as a concise, factual 
bullet point list.  The points will of course differ for each project, 
but an example is as follows:

\begin{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\item I spent $120$ hours collecting material on and learning about the 
      Java garbage-collection sub-system. 
\item I wrote a total of $5000$ lines of source code, comprising a Linux 
      device driver for a robot (in C) and a GUI (in Java) that is 
      used to control it.
\item I designed a new algorithm for computing the non-linear mapping 
      from A-space to B-space using a genetic algorithm, see page $17$.
\item I implemented a version of the algorithm proposed by Jones and 
      Smith in [6], see page $12$, corrected a mistake in it, and 
      compared the results with several alternatives.
\end{itemize}
