Such an analog quantum computer for this specific problem provides a shortcut to boost the absolute computing power of quantum computers to beat classical ones. However, the capacity bound of classical computers for simulating boson sampling has not yet been identified. Here we simulate boson sampling on the Tianhe-2 supercomputer, which occupied the first place in the world ranking six times from 2013 to 2016. We computed the permanent of the largest matrix using up to 312â€‰000 CPU cores of Tianhe-2, and inferred from the current most efficient permanent-computing algorithms that an upper bound on the performance of Tianhe-2 is one 50-photon sample per âˆ¼100Â min. In addition, we found a precision issue with one of two permanent-computing algorithms.}",

Carolan et al. developed a reconfigurable integrated waveguide device fabricated in a glass chip (see the Perspective by Rohde and Dowling). The device allowed for universal linear optics transformations on six wave-guides using 15 integrated Mach-Zehnder interferometers, each of which was individually programmable. Functional performance in a number of applications in optics and quantum optics demonstrates the versatility of the device{\textquoteright}s reprogrammable architecture.Science, this issue p. 711; see also p. 696Linear optics underpins fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and quantum technologies. We demonstrate a single reprogrammable optical circuit that is sufficient to implement all possible linear optical protocols up to the size of that circuit. Our six-mode universal system consists of a cascade of 15 Mach-Zehnder interferometers with 30 thermo-optic phase shifters integrated into a single photonic chip that is electrically and optically interfaced for arbitrary setting of all phase shifters, input of up to six photons, and their measurement with a 12-single-photon detector system. We programmed this system to implement heralded quantum logic and entangling gates, boson sampling with verification tests, and six-dimensional complex Hadamards. We implemented 100 Haar random unitaries with an average fidelity of 0.999 {\textpm} 0.001. Our system can be rapidly reprogrammed to implement these and any other linear optical protocol, pointing the way to applications across fundamental science and quantum technologies.},

The thesis would be strongly contradicted by physical devices that efficiently perform tasks believed to be intractable for classical computers. Such a task is boson sampling: sampling the output distributions of n bosons scattered by some passive, linear unitary process. We tested the central premise of boson sampling, experimentally verifying that three-photon scattering amplitudes are given by the permanents of submatrices generated from a unitary describing a six-mode integrated optical circuit. We find the protocol to be robust, working even with the unavoidable effects of photon loss, non-ideal sources, and imperfect detection. Scaling this to large numbers of photons should be a much simpler task than building a universal quantum computer.},

We construct a quantum boson sampling machine (QBSM) to sample the output distribution resulting from the nonclassical interference of photons in an integrated photonic circuit, a problem thought to be exponentially hard to solve classically. Unlike universal quantum computation, boson sampling merely requires indistinguishable photons, linear state evolution, and detectors. We benchmark our QBSM with three and four photons and analyze sources of sampling inaccuracy. Scaling up to larger devices could offer the first definitive quantum-enhanced computation.},

    abstract = { The boson sampling problem has brought a lot of attention in the quantum information field because it is not efficiently solvable with a classical computer; nonetheless it can be implementable with linear optical interferometers with single-boson sources. Recently, we introduced a more general problem, the multi-boson correlation sampling problem, which allows to take advantage of the muti-mode spectral distribution of the bosonic sources together with time-correlated measurements in order to achieve a sampling not only over the output channels of the interferometer but also over the joint detection times. This problem was analyzed for both single-photon sources and thermal sources. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to use single qubit bosonic sources in order to sample not only in the described "space-time" degree of freedom but also over all the possible exponential number of multi-qubit output states. }

	abstract = {We explore the possibility of efficient classical simulation of linear optics experiments under the effect of particle losses. Specifically, we investigate the canonical boson sampling scenario in which an n-particle Fock input state propagates through a linear-optical network and is subsequently measured by particle-number detectors in the m output modes. We examine two models of losses. In the first model a fixed number of particles is lost. We prove that in this scenario the output statistics can be well approximated by an efficient classical simulation, provided that the number of photons that is left grows slower than . In the second loss model, every time a photon passes through a beamsplitter in the network, it has some probability of being lost. For this model the relevant parameter is s, the smallest number of beamsplitters that any photon traverses as it propagates through the network. We prove that it is possible to approximately simulate the output statistics already if s grows logarithmically with m, regardless of the geometry of the network. The latter result is obtained by proving that it is always possible to commute s layers of uniform losses to the input of the network regardless of its geometry, which could be a result of independent interest. We believe that our findings put strong limitations on future experimental realizations of quantum computational supremacy proposals based on boson sampling.}

These interferometers are typically composed of a regular mesh of beam splitters and phase shifters, allowing for straightforward fabrication using integrated photonic architectures and ready scalability. The current, standard design for universal multiport interferometers is based on work by Reck et al. \[Phys. Rev. Lett.73, 58 (1994)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.73.58\]. We demonstrate a new design for universal multiport interferometers based on an alternative arrangement of beam splitters and phase shifters, which outperforms that by Reck et al. Our design requires half the optical depth of the Reck design and is significantly more robust to optical losses.},

abstract={Implementing large instances of quantum algorithms1-5 requires the processing of many quantum information carriers in a hardware platform that supports the integration of different components6. Although established semiconductor fabrication processes can integrate many photonic components7, the generation and algorithmic processing of many photons has been a bottleneck in integrated photonics. Here, we report the on-chip generation and algorithmic processing of quantum states of light with up to eight photons. Switching between different optical pumping regimes, we implement the scattershot8,9, Gaussian10 and standard boson sampling3,11-14 protocols in the same silicon chip, which integrates linear and nonlinear photonic circuitry. We use these results to benchmark a quantum algorithm for calculating molecular vibronic spectra4. Our techniques can be readily scaled for the on-chip implementation of specialized quantum algorithms with tens of photons, pointing the way to efficiency advantages over conventional computers15.},
