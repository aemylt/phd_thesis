abstract = { A “branch and bound” algorithm is presented for solving the traveling salesman problem. The set of all tours (feasible solutions) is broken up into increasingly small subsets by a procedure called branching. For each subset a lower bound on the length of the tours therein is calculated. Eventually, a subset is found that contains a single tour whose length is less than or equal to some lower bound for every tour. The motivation of the branching and the calculation of the lower bounds are based on ideas frequently used in solving assignment problems. Computationally, the algorithm extends the size of problem that can reasonably be solved without using methods special to the particular problem. }

    abstract = { We consider partitioning algorithms for the approximate solution of large instances of the traveling-salesman problem in the plane. These algorithms subdivide the set of cities into small groups, construct an optimum tour through each group, and then patch the subtours together to form a tour through all the cities. If the number of cities in the problem is n, and the number of cities in each group is t, then the worst-case error is \$O(\sqrt{n/t})\$. If the cities are randomly distributed, then the relative error is O(t−1/2) (with probability one). Hybrid schemes are suggested, in which partitioning is used in conjunction with existing heuristic algorithms. These hybrid schemes may be expected to give near-optimum solutions to problems with thousands of cities. }

abstract="Highly-interconnected networks of nonlinear analog neurons are shown to be extremely effective in computing. The networks can rapidly provide a collectively-computed solution (a digital output) to a problem on the basis of analog input information. The problems to be solved must be formulated in terms of desired optima, often subject to constraints. The general principles involved in constructing networks to solve specific problems are discussed. Results of computer simulations of a network designed to solve a difficult but well-defined optimization problem-the Traveling-Salesman Problem-are presented and used to illustrate the computational power of the networks. Good solutions to this problem are collectively computed within an elapsed time of only a few neural time constants. The effectiveness of the computation involves both the nonlinear analog response of the neurons and the large connectivity among them. Dedicated networks of biological or microelectronic neurons could provide the computational capabilities described for a wide class of problems having combinatorial complexity. The power and speed naturally displayed by such collective networks may contribute to the effectiveness of biological information processing.",

  abstract={We present an exact quantum algorithm for solving the Exact Satisfiability problem, which belongs to the important NP-complete complexity class. The algorithm is based on an intuitive approach that can be divided into two parts: the first step consists in the identification and efficient characterization of a restricted subspace that contains all the valid assignments of the Exact Satisfiability; while the second part performs a quantum search in such restricted subspace. The quantum algorithm can be used either to find a valid assignment (or to certify that no solution exists) or to count the total number of valid assignments. The query complexities for the worst-case are respectively bounded by ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/18/7/073003/njpaa2afbieqn1.gif] {$O(\sqrt{{2}^{n-{M}^{\prime }}})$} and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/18/7/073003/njpaa2afbieqn2.gif] {$O({2}^{n-{M}^{\prime }})$} , where n is the number of variables and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/18/7/073003/njpaa2afbieqn3.gif] {${M}^{\prime }$} the number of linearly independent clauses. Remarkably, the proposed quantum algorithm results to be faster than any known exact classical algorithm to solve dense formulas of Exact Satisfiability. As a concrete application, we provide the worst-case complexity for the Hamiltonian cycle problem obtained after mapping it to a suitable Occupation problem. Specifically, we show that the time complexity for the proposed quantum algorithm is bounded by ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/18/7/073003/njpaa2afbieqn4.gif] {$O({2}^{n/4})$} for 3-regular undirected graphs, where n is the number of nodes. The same worst-case complexity holds for ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/18/7/073003/njpaa2afbieqn5.gif] {$(3,3)$} -regular bipartite graphs. As a reference, the current best classical algorithm has a (worst-case) running time bounded by ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/18/7/073003/njpaa2afbieqn6.gif] {$O({2}^{31n/96})$} . Finally, when compared to heuristic techniques for Exact Satisfiability problems, the proposed quantum algorithm is faster than the classical WalkSAT and Adiabatic Quantum Optimization for random instances with a density of constraints close to the satisfiability threshold, the regime in which instances are typically the hardest to solve. The proposed quantum algorithm can be straightforwardly extended to the generalized version of the Exact Satisfiability known as Occupation problem. The general version of the algorithm is presented and analyzed.}

abstract="We introduce a meta-heuristic to combine simulated annealing with local search methods for CO problems. This new class of Markov chains leads to significantly more powerful optimization methods than either simulated annealing or local search. The main idea is to embed deterministic local search techniques into simulated annealing so that the chain explores only local optima. It makes large, global changes, even at low temperatures, thus overcoming large barriers in configuration space. We have tested this meta-heuristic for the traveling salesman and graph partitioning problems. Tests on instances from public libraries and random ensembles quantify the power of the method. Our algorithm is able to solve large instances to optimality, improving upon local search methods very significantly. For the traveling salesman problem with randomly distributed cities, in a square, the procedure improves on 3-opt by 1.6{\%}, and on Lin-Kernighan local search by 1.3{\%}. For the partitioning of sparse random graphs of average degree equal to 5, the improvement over Kernighan-Lin local search is 8.9{\%}. For both CO problems, we obtain new best heuristics.",
