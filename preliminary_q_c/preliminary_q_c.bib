Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.",

Although the general SAT problem is NP-complete, advancements in solver algorithms and heuristics have meant that many industrial problems can be quickly and efficiently solved. Much of this progress has been made in the field of sequential SAT solvers; however, there have been significant recent contributions to the field of hardware SAT accelerators. This paper offers a short overview of the current state of SAT solvers in general and surveys recent contributions to hardware accelerated SAT solvers. This paper also aims to analyze the trends, challenges, and open questions facing reconfigurable SAT solvers in an extremely competitive application area."
