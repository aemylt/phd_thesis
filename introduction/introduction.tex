Some of the contents of this thesis has been published previously, or completed in collaboration with other academics. All work in these chapters was led by myself, and all text in these chapters is my own writing.

\begin{itemize}
\item Chapter \ref{chp:tsp} is joint work with Noah Linden and Ashley Montanaro, and has been published as ``Quantum Speedup of the Travelling Salesman Problem for bounded-degree graphs'', \href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.95.032323}{\textit{Physical Review A} \textbf{95}, 032323 (2017)} [{\tt \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06203}{arXiv:1612.06203}}]\footnote{Note that this work was completed and published under my former name.}.

\item Chapter \ref{chp:noisy_circuit} is joint work with Peter S.\ Turner, and has been published as ``Quantum simulation of partially distinguishable boson sampling'', \href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.97.062329}{\textit{Physical Review A} \textbf{97}, 062329 (2018)} [{\tt \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03657}{arXiv:1803.03657}}].

\item Chapter \ref{chp:classical_sim} is joint work with Ra\'{u}l Garc\'{i}a-Patr\'{o}n, Jelmer J. Renema and Peter S. Turner, and has been published as as ``Classically simulating near-term partially-distinguishable and lossy boson sampling'', \href{https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/ab5555}{\textit{Quantum Science and Technology} \textbf{5}, 015001 (2020)} [{\tt \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00022}{arXiv:1907.00022}}]
