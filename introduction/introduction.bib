abstract={Quantum computers promise to efficiently solve important problems that are intractable on a conventional computer. For quantum systems, where the physical dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ans{\"a}tze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry--calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He-H+. The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future.},

This chapter traces the history of combinatorial optimization. As a coherent mathematical discipline, combinatorial optimization is relatively young. Linear programming forms the hinge in the history of combinatorial optimization. Its initial conception by Kantorovich and Koopmans was motivated by combinatorial applications—in particular, in transportation and transshipment. The assignment problem is one of the first investigated combinatorial optimization problems. A breakthrough in solving the assignment problem came when Dantzig showed that the assignment problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem that automatically has an integer optimum solution. The reason is a theorem of Birkhoff [1946] stating that the convex hull of the permutation matrices is equal to the set of doubly stochastic matrices—nonnegative matrices in which each row and column sum is equal to 1. Therefore, minimizing a linear functional over the set of doubly stochastic matrices (which is a linear programming problem) gives a permutation matrix, being the optimum assignment."

abstract={Quantum computational algorithms exploit quantum mechanics to solve problems exponentially faster than the best classical algorithms1,2,3. Shor's quantum algorithm4 for fast number factoring is a key example and the prime motivator in the international effort to realize a quantum computer5. However, due to the substantial resource requirement, to date there have been only four small-scale demonstrations6,7,8,9. Here, we address this resource demand and demonstrate a scalable version of Shor's algorithm in which the n-qubit control register is replaced by a single qubit that is recycled n times: the total number of qubits is one-third of that required in the standard protocol10,11. Encoding the work register in higher-dimensional states, we implement a two-photon compiled algorithm to factor N?=?21. The algorithmic output is distinguishable from noise, in contrast to previous demonstrations. These results point to larger-scale implementations of Shor's algorithm by harnessing scalable resource reductions applicable to all physical architectures.},

In a photonic architecture, where single-qubit gates can be performed easily and precisely, the application of consecutive two-qubit entangling gates has been a significant obstacle. Here, we demonstrate a two-qubit photonic quantum processor that implements two consecutive CNOT gates on the same pair of polarisation-encoded qubits. To demonstrate the flexibility of our system, we implement various instances of the quantum algorithm for solving of systems of linear equations.},
