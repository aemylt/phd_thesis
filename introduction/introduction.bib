abstract={Quantum computers promise to efficiently solve important problems that are intractable on a conventional computer. For quantum systems, where the physical dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ans{\"a}tze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry--calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He-H+. The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future.},

This chapter traces the history of combinatorial optimization. As a coherent mathematical discipline, combinatorial optimization is relatively young. Linear programming forms the hinge in the history of combinatorial optimization. Its initial conception by Kantorovich and Koopmans was motivated by combinatorial applications—in particular, in transportation and transshipment. The assignment problem is one of the first investigated combinatorial optimization problems. A breakthrough in solving the assignment problem came when Dantzig showed that the assignment problem can be formulated as a linear programming problem that automatically has an integer optimum solution. The reason is a theorem of Birkhoff [1946] stating that the convex hull of the permutation matrices is equal to the set of doubly stochastic matrices—nonnegative matrices in which each row and column sum is equal to 1. Therefore, minimizing a linear functional over the set of doubly stochastic matrices (which is a linear programming problem) gives a permutation matrix, being the optimum assignment."
